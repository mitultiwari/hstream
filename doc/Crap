Email addresses are not currently verified. Fields 'token' and 'confirmed' in
the emails table are unused.

Servers can only run in dev environment. In prod they can't serve static files
for some reason.

All environments use the *same* db. Any crawlers or notifiers or servers you
run on a single machine share the same db, no matter where you run them from.

Crawler isn't saving timestamps. Unclear what format mysql wants for them.
